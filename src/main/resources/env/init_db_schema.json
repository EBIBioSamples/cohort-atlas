    "description": "Based at the University of Bristol, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), also known as Children of the 90s, is a world-leading birth cohort study.\\n Between April 1991 and December 1992 we recruited more than 14,000 pregnant women into the study and these women (some of whom had two pregnancies or multiple births during the recruitment period), the children arising from the pregnancy, and their partners have been followed up intensively over two decades.\\n We are the most detailed study of its kind in the world and we provide the international research community with a rich resource for the study of the environmental and genetic factors that affect a person’s health and development. Through our research we aim to inform policy and practices that will provide a better life for future generations.",

    "description": "The study was started by professor Paula Rantakallio in the two Northernmost provinces in Finland (Oulu and Lapland) already in the year 1965 when the mothers were pregnant. Data on the individuals born into this cohort was collected since the 24th gestational week as well as their mothers and, to a lesser extent, fathers. The cohort included 12055 mothers and they had 12068 deliveries (13 women delivered twice).\\nCases belonging to survey were determined by the calculated term. A small percentage of the births occurred towards the end of 1965 and early in 1967. The calculated term, as was customary at that time, was counted from the first day of the last menstrual period. Where this date was unknown the expected term was estimated from the  date of commencement of foetal ovements and progress of the pregnancy. The study covered all live born and stillborn infants with birth weight of 600 grams or more.\\nAccording to the Finland's central Office of Statistics, births in the study area during 1966 totalled 12527, so study population comprised 96.3 per cent of all births during 1966 in that area. Altogether 12231 children were born into the cohort, 12058 of them live born. The original data have been supplemented by data collected with postal questionnaires at the ages of 1, 14 and 31 years and various hospital records and national register data.",

The study is designed to identify early environmental and genetic causes and causal pathways leading to normal and abnormal growth, development and health from fetal life, childhood and young adulthood. This multidisciplinary study focuses on several health outcomes including behaviour and cognition, body composition, eye development, growth, hearing, heart and vascular development, infectious disease and immunity, oral health and facial growth, respiratory health, allergy and skin disorders of children and their parents. Main exposures of interest include environmental, endocrine, genomic (genetic, epigenetic, microbiome), lifestyle related, nutritional and socio-demographic determinants. \\nPregnant women with an expected delivery date between April 2002 and January 2006 living in Rotterdam were eligible for participation in the study. In total, 9778 mothers were enrolled in the study, who gave birth to 9749 live born children. Extensive assessments are performed in mothers, fathers and their children. Measurements were planned in early pregnancy (gestational age <18 weeks), mid pregnancy (gestational age 18–25 weeks) and late pregnancy (gestational age >25 weeks). The fathers were assessed once during the pregnancy of their partner. The children form a prenatally recruited birth cohort that will be followed at least until young adulthood. In the preschool period, which in the Netherlands refers to the period from birth until the age of 4 years, data collection was performed by a home-visit at the age of 3 months, and by repeated questionnaires and routine child health centers visits. Information from these routine visits was obtained and used for the study. Additional detailed measurements of fetal and postnatal growth and development were conducted in a randomly selected subgroup of Dutch children and their parents at a gestational age of 32 weeks and postnatally at the ages of 1.5, 6, 14, 24, 36 and 48 months in a dedicated research center.\\nAround the ages of 6 and 10 years all children and their parents were invited to visit our research center in the Erasmus MC-Sophia Children’s Hospital to participate in hands-on measurements, advanced imaging modalities, behavioural observations and biological sample collection. MRI scans of all participating children were made in order to image abdominal composition, brain, lungs, cardiovascular system, fat tissue, kidney, liver, and hip development. Furthermore, the parents received 6 questionnaires during this period. Children also received their own questionnaire around the age of 10. Information from municipal health services, schools and general practicionars has also been collected. Response at baseline was 61%, and general follow-up rates until the age of 10 years were around 80%.",
